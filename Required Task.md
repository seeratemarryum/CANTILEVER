## Keylogger with Active Screenshot Capture
 
 Create a Python script to log keystrokes using the pynput library.
 Capture screenshots of the active screen/window at regular intervals using
 pyautogui or Pillow.
 Associate each set of keystrokes with its corresponding screenshot for contextual
 analysis.
 Store all logs and screenshots in a timestamped folder on the system for later review.
 Use threading to run both keystroke logging and screen capturing concurrently in the background
